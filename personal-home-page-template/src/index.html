    <p class="par"> This part of the web page it’s about myself. So, I will be starting with my personal information: My name is Ahmed Osman Mahmoud, and I am from Eritrea, but I was born in Saudi Aribia 1994 in Rabigh City, and I spend all my life over there and never been in Eritrea at all. I have family consisting of five sons and three daughters.
I was living a bad life in Saudi Aribia because I couldn’t complete my study, so I find the best decision is to move to England to change my life to better, so I start with improve my English and Math. I am in level one secondly, I’ve complete level two and I finished level one, two and three in Information Technology.  I find myself in this area because I noticed that I’m spending most of my time learning a new things in the computer and I saw this challenge will give me a huge chance to change in my life.
Last year, l was trying to learn about html and CSS by myself, but I felt lost because I could not find how to achieve the right way to the end point.
Within I learn English course my teacher notes I interest to learn coding and told me about this opportunity with code your future is available now I applied straight away to book a place to start with CYF.
I can see my future throw this opportunity; therefore, I don’t want to lose it.
In addition to my hobbies, I love playing a football and go swimming in my free time, but my favourite sport is volleyball.
I moved to the United Kingdom in December 2015, and I spend two almost one and half year in Bradford after that I decided to move to Manchester that was in September 2017; and the first area is Levenshulme, and I been there for period than I moved to 76 John Heywood Street at Clayton neighbourhood in 2019. Clayton is a suburb of Manchester, England, 3 miles east of the city centre on Ashton New Road. Historically in Lancashire, Clayton takes its name from the Clayton family who owned large parts of land around the area, including Clayton Vale, through which the River Medlock flows, separating Clayton from Newton Heath.
Also, I can describe myself as foody, because I love food so much and I like to try different type of food like Arabic food, African food, and Middle East food. I am trying to learn how to cook myself and I feel enjoy when I do cook.
One of my big dreams is to visit Japan because I want to see how they are living with modern technology and how is their culture also I want to visit South Africa so from what I heard South Africa it is mixed country. In addition to my dreams, I want to do skydiving I know it is no easy, but I will do.
I hope this enough to know me.
